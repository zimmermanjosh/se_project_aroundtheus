# **AboutMe**

- Hello my name is Joshua B. Zimmerman. This project is remake as I dumped the previous project and I needed to retry to completely understand what I was doing. I have built a design based on a FIGMA shared project, additionally I have improvised troubleshooting, testing and released this project on gitPages.

- This project shows a usage of a shared FIGMA project ui file, containing both desktop projects, and mobile project with specific size settings, styling and resolutions. - - This is a project that is meant to represent an a example of a unifiied and dynamic website. This is to be used as a growing, and changing project thoughout the rest of class, more to come !!!!
